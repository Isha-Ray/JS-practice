//Make a function getFullName(first, last) that returns the full name as a string.


function getFullName(first, last) {
  return first + " " + last; //This line joins the first and last names into one string with a space in between.
}

let fullName = getFullName("Isha", "Ray");
console.log(fullName);  // Output: Isha Ray
